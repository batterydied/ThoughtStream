# Blog Web App

## Overview

This project is a simple blog web application that allows users to create, edit, and delete blog posts. It focuses on backend development concepts using **Express.js** as the server framework, **EJS** for templating, and **jQuery** for client-side scripting. No database is used; instead, the blog posts are stored temporarily in memory, making this project a great exercise for understanding how the backend and server operations work without the complexity of persistent data storage.

## Features

- **Create Blog Posts**: Users can write and submit new blog posts.
- **Edit Blog Posts**: Users can update the content of existing blog posts.
- **Delete Blog Posts**: Users can remove unwanted blog posts.
- **Basic Routing**: Handles routes for listing all blogs, viewing a specific blog, creating new blogs, editing existing blogs, and deleting blogs.
- **jQuery Integration**: Utilized for enhancing client-side interactions, such as form submissions and dynamic page updates without a full page reload.

## Technologies Used

- **Express.js**: A minimalist web framework for Node.js.
- **EJS (Embedded JavaScript Templates)**: For rendering dynamic content on the server side.
- **jQuery**: A popular JavaScript library for handling DOM manipulation, events, and AJAX requests.
- **CSS**: For basic styling of the web pages.
- **Node.js**: Provides server-side functionality and handles routing.
